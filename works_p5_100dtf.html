  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br> <br>
  exhibition text: <br>
  “An onion will not produce a rose”- this adage is usually quoted to show that every cause has its own result. When it comes digital imagery however, this saying can be taken literally, and applied to any image. Of course, a digital image of a pea is completely detached from the process of natural growth and the organic forms that result from it, for digital imagery exists only as a sum of the data it consists of. <br>
  This project focuses on the differences in the creation and growth processes of natural and digital entities, placing emphasis on the illogicality of a digitally imaged natural object mimicking a method of natural creation (the growth of fruit) through a method of digital manipulation (distortion using the Photoshop smudge tool).</h3>
